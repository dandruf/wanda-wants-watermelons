# Wanda Wants Watermelons: Up Next...

So what's next? Obviously, this isn't a fully fleshed-out game, and I don't just want to leave it at this. This is a checklist of things I want to add in the next iteration of this game.

### Design
- [ ] Draw my own Wanda spritesheet
- [ ] Implement PECS symbols, as per the original intention of the game
- [ ] Create animations for correct and incorrect answers (and friendly and unfriendly fruits)

### Code
- [ ] Implement new levels
- [ ] Create a title page
- [ ] Create more minigame and command possibilities
